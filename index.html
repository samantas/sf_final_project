                <h2>How We Score</h2>
                <span>
                    We take two factors into account when we score a product - the brand and the textiles - each contributing to 50% of the result. Brands' attitude towards sustainability varies. Different brands display different levels of transparency regarding how they source, manufacture, and treat their workers.
                    <br><br>
                    We have drawn inspiration from and rely on the reports provided by <a href="https://goodonyou.eco/" target="_blank" class="dark-bold-link">Good On You</a>, a website that provides consumers with trusted ethical ratings. They rate brands based on how their pieces affect the environment, people, and animals.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of textiles, we follow a basic principle that natural organic fabrics are more sustainable than artificial ones. We also consider durability and blend type, as some blends are harder to recycle due to separation.
                    <br><br>
                    While this is not an exhaustive list of factors that affect the sustainability of a piece of clothing, these are the factors that we consider. Our goal is simply to inform and hopefully make your decision to buy easier.

                <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
                Consumers can contribute to making fashion more sustainable by making conscious purchasing choices. Sustainable fashion goes beyond thinking about the environment. Sustainable fashion cares about the earth, the humans, as well as the animals that inhabit it. It cares about making ethical choices.
